Today I felt that I am lacking in recursion so I started to deep dive in recursion. I actually went through some basic problems like calculating power of a
number which is raised to the power n, Checking if a string is palindrome or not,etc. Got to know about two inbuilt functions tolower and isalphanum.

Observations : 

1) Never go deep into how the recursion is working. You will get confused.
2) Apply logic for the first case and ask recursion to do the remaining.
3) Recursion makes code so simple and also more readable.
4) There are cases where recursion is best and also where the recursion is worst.
5) Focus on the sub problem first, The larger problem itself gets solved.


Problem 1 : 
Q : Calculate the value of x^n using recursion.

Code : 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int answer(int base,int exp){
    if(exp==0){
        return 1;
    }
    if(base==0){
        return 0;
    }
    return base*answer(base,exp-1);
}
int main(){
    int base,exp;
    cin>>base>>exp;
    cout<<answer(base,exp);
}

Explaination : As I said in the formula we are just multiplying the first number with a function which returns the value for us until exp is not zero.
Let us suppose base=3 and exp=5, the answer we get is 243. So this is how the recursion runs in the background.
Diagram : refer the images(Recursion-1.0).


Problem 2: 
Q : A String is given where the string is combination of alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric as well. You have to ignore all the non-alphanumeric, consider
all upper case letters also as lower case and then check whether the string is a palindrome or not.

Code :
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 bool isPalindrome(string s) {
    int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1;
        while(i < j){
            while(i < j && !isalnum(s[i])) i++;
            while(i < j && !isalnum(s[j])) j--;
            if(tolower(s[i++]) != tolower(s[j--])) return false;
        }
        return true; 
    }
int main()
{
    string s="A man, a plan, a canal: Panama";
    if(isPalindrome(s)){
        cout<<"is a palindrome"<<endl;
    }else{
        cout<<"No"<<endl;
    }
    
}


Problem 3:
Q:Check if a string is a palindrome or not when all the characters are lower case alphabets.

Code:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
bool check(int l,int r,string &s){
    
    if(l==r){
        //if there is only one character in the string
        return true;
    }
    if(s[l]!=s[r]){
        //if first and last character are not same
        return false;
    }
    if(l>=r){
        //both hals are same and there is symmetry
        return true;
    }
    if(s[l]==s[r]){
        //if first and last are same then check for remaining characters
       return check(l+1,r-1,s);
    }
    return false;
}
bool isPalindrome(string s){
    bool res=true;
    int l=0,r=s.size()-1;
    res=check(l,r,s);
    return res;
}
int main(){
    string s;
    cin>>s;
    cout<<isPalindrome(s);
}
