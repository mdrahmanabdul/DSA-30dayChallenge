  Twist : I have learnt how to create a basic flutter application and also learnt how to run that application in my phone(Andriod). I have learnt about 
  Scaffold tag with which we can insert images, text and how to center the components.
  I have also learnt how to insert images from the assests folder by altering pubspec.yaml file. I have also learnt how to change the app icon by replacing
  default app icon.
  Resources : appicon generator
